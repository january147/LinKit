  size 
      the file size 

3. procedure

  3.1 send file
      
    A [^type:ask/cmd:send/datatype:file/name:test.txt/size:1024$] ---> B
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:reject$]
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:accept$]
        |-- A [file contnent bytes] ---> B
            |-- A <--- B[^type:res/status:ok$]
            |-- A <--- B[^type:res/status:failed$]
    
    
  3.2 send message
    
    Note: when the message size is less than 100 bytes and includes no "^", "/" , ":" and "$", it can be sended with the control message.

    A [^type:ask/cmd:send/datatype:msg/contnet:a test file content$] ---> B
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:reject$]
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:failed$]
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:ok$]

    A [^type:ask/cmd:send/datatype:msg] ---> B
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:reject$]
    |-- A <--- B [^type:res/status:accept$]
        |-- A [message] ---> B
            |-- A <--- B[^type:res/status:ok$]
            |-- A <--- B[^type:res/status:failed$]
